Which insights did you gain from your EDA? Were any columns
highly correlated? If so, name them.

 How did you determine which columns to drop or keep? If your EDA
informed this process, explain which insights you used to determine
which columns were not needed.

After a through EDA I was able to identify that the majority of the columns would need to be kept as they represented diverse informative data upon the characterization and clustering of the songs. I dropped lyrics and track name as they were indisincratic identifyiers and could not offer much information to cluster the songs.


iii. What was the optimal number of clusters in your cluster model?
Explain how you determined this value.


iv. Take a look at the respective songs that fell into your clusters.
Describe these clusters in human terms to the best of your ability
using the columns in your dataset (for example high-gospel songs,
low-gospel songs, etc). Feel free to listen to these songs as well to
get a sense of what nuance your algorithm picked up on.
v. Take a look at the clusters that your algorithm assigned to your test
samples. Based on these clusters, which songs would you
recommend to this user?
